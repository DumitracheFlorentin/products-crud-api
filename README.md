![CRUD API](./design/postman_routes.png)


## Description

Creating a short CRUD API Applcation using Node.js, Express. The data was taken from a JS file, in this example I did not use a database, I wanted to keep the project to a standard level and learn more about what CRUD means.

## Usage

### Env Variables

Create .env file in then root and add the following

```
PORT = xxxx
```

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

## How to check results

- I recommand to use Postman to see the results, they have an application made to see the data in a better way than browser.
